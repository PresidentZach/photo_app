# photo_app  
*(Unofficially known as Photosynthesis)*

**photo_app** is a full-stack web application for uploading, viewing, and managing photos. Developed using Django and Supabase, it features secure user authentication, streamlined photo uploads, and structured gallery organization.


## Purpose

This project was created as part of our Software Engineering course (CSIT 413) at SUNY Fredonia. It was designed to showcase our ability to plan, build, and deliver a complete web solution using Agile practices.


## Resources We Used

- Django
- Supabase (Database)
  With the limited time we had to complete the project, we chose to use Supabase as our database source as opposed to something like Azure or AWS because Supabase offers user authentication and hosting.
- Imgur (Photo storage)

## What We Learned

- Working collaboratively in a team using Agile methodologies.
- Using Kanban for task traching and team coordination. 
- Backend development with Django and API integration tools.
- Utilizing Supabase for storage and authentication.
- Frontend / backend coordination for a smooth user experience.
